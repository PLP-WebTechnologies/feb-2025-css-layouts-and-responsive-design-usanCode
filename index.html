  <h2><u>Gisenyi</u></h2>

  <p>Gisenyi (also referred to by its new name Rubavu) is a large town of Rwanda in central Africa 
    spread over several hills . I love this town because it is ashore 
    of the lake Kivu and has a beautiful beach. I spent most of my childhood there. 
    I really miss this place. </p>

  <h2><u>Paris</u></h2>

  <p>Paris is the capital of France and it is located near the Seine river.
    What I love about Paris is that this city is a great cultural and historical center, 
    so much so that one can say that Paris is an open-air museum. </p>
